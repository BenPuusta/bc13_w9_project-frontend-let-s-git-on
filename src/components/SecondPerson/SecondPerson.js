// this component will need a drop down box to choose who you played against - the list of other players will be passed in here as props from Results

// this componened needs a header with the second player's nickname in it (passed in from other player's state in Results as props)
// this component also needs to show some kind of avatar image underneath the header
// under that this component will show all of the answers of the second player (passed in from second player's state in Results as props)
// both the header and the answers will use the same state from Results so will access parts of it with dot notation
